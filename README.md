# acis_temp_precip_scatter

This python code pulls temperature and precipitation data for user-defined stations over a user-defined time period from ACIS, then uses plotly to generate scatterplots.

Requires pandas and plotly to be installed, as well as [kaleido](https://plotly.com/python/static-image-export/]) if you want to write the plots to image files.

The resulting plots look will look something like this:
